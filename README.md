# Hugo Content with Pages and Navigation

While converting my WordPress content into markdown files for Hugo, I wanted to keep my permalinks exactly the same. For my existing content that spans more than a single page, I created a way to do this without server rewrite rules or Hugo aliases that use `meta refresh` which is sub-optimal for SEO performance.
